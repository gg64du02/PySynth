Look for flute synth synthesis in specialized audio software

fix the offset bug (between loops ?) ()
->maybe due from the fact that the harmonics are not perfect multiple
->yes this is making the overall shape a little bit wobbly
->but why the offset ?

generate with ctrnn ?

generate with samples ?

generate with 1/1.5 frequencies? 


DONE: include phases from the paper


ALWAYS BEFORE LISTENING:
-check a third party sound equilizer on your computer
-check if you harware is capable of all the frequance spectum
(Sound card AND headphones/speaker)
-check for spectrum analysis such as in Audacity

-You should favorise headphones over speakers
